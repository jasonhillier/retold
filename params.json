{"name":"Retold","tagline":"A story-obsessed application suite.","body":"> Every truth has two sides; it is as well to \r\n> look at both, before we commit ourselves to either.\r\n>> Aesop\r\n\r\nData contains so many stories.  With the right tools, developers can enable users to be amazing storytellers.  We can even tell stories of our own!\r\n\r\n### Fable: Core Services\r\nIt is tiring to setup logging and settings management in every application you write.  Fable provides a single line solution to have simple logging to the console via [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan).  Add a simple configuration object and it can also write the log to a file.  Or even mongodb!\r\n\r\n### Orator: Restful Web Server\r\nWe think [restify](https://github.com/restify/node-restify) is pretty awesome.  But using it in each application server or microservice turned into the same 25 or 50 lines of boilerplate code.  With Orator you can just configure what you want.\r\n\r\n### Meadow: Data Access & Automatic Endpoints\r\nWho doesn't love writing the same code over and over again?\r\n\r\n### Foxhound: Programmatic Query Generation\r\nWrite the same code.  Access mongo, mysql or whatever.\r\n\r\n### Pict: Markdown Inspired Data Definition Layer\r\nScribble a few words down and voila!  Database create statements, documentation, graphs, mock objects for unit tests and a bunch more.  Plays well with meadow.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
